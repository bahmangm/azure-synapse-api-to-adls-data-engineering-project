# Earthquake Data Ingestion & Processing Pipeline using Azure Synapse

This repository contains an end-to-end data pipeline implemented using **Azure Synapse Notebooks** to ingest, process, and enrich **earthquake data** from the [USGS Earthquake API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/). The pipeline is organized in a **multi-layered architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold)** and is executed daily to ensure a steady flow of fresh, near real-time data.

## üìå Project Structure

- **Bronze Layer**  
  Retrieves raw earthquake data from the USGS API and saves it in **JSON** format into the **Bronze ADLS Gen2** container.

- **Silver Layer**  
  Reads and flattens the nested JSON data, selects relevant fields (e.g., coordinates, magnitude, time), performs basic cleaning and validation, and stores the results in **Parquet** format in the **Silver ADLS Gen2** container.

- **Gold Layer**  
  Enriches the data by:
  - Using **reverse geocoding** (via `reverse_geocoder`) to append **country codes** based on latitude and longitude.
  - Adding a **significance classification** (Low / Moderate / High) based on the `sig` value.
  - Saving the enriched dataset in **Parquet** format to the **Gold ADLS Gen2** container.

## üîÅ Automation

This pipeline is configured with a **daily trigger** in Azure Synapse Pipelines.  
Thanks to this automation, the system continuously ingests fresh data, enabling **near real-time analytics** and up-to-date insights.
